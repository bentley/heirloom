     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Indxbib</I> makes an inverted index to the named
<I>databases</I> (or files) for use by
<I>lookbib</I>(1B)
and
<I>refer</I>(1B).
These files contain bibliographic references
(or other kinds of information) separated by blank lines.
<P>
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines,
constituting fields of bibliographic information.
Each field starts on a line beginning with a &#39;&#39;%&#39;&#39;,
followed by a key-letter, then a blank,
and finally the contents of the field,
which may continue until the next line starting with &#39;&#39;%&#39;&#39;.
<P>
<I>Indxbib</I> is a shell script that calls
/usr/ucblib/reftools/mkey and /usr/ucblib/reftools/inv.
The first program,
<I>mkey,</I> truncates words to 6 characters,
and maps upper case to lower case.
It also discards words shorter than 3 characters,
words among the 100 most common English words,
and numbers (dates) &lt; 1900 or &gt; 2000.
These parameters can be changed; see page 4 of the
<I>Refer</I> document by Mike Lesk.
The second program,
<I>inv,</I> creates an entry file (.ia),
a posting file (.ib), and a tag file (.ic),
all in the working directory.
<P>
<I>Lookbib</I> uses an inverted index made by
<I>indxbib</I> to find sets of bibliographic references.
It reads keywords typed after the &#39;&#39;&gt;&#39;&#39; prompt on the terminal,
and retrieves records containing all these keywords.
If nothing matches, nothing is returned except another &#39;&#39;&gt;&#39;&#39; prompt.
<P>
<I>Lookbib</I> will ask if you need instructions, and will print some brief information if
you reply &#39;&#39;y&#39;&#39;.  The &#39;&#39;-n&#39;&#39; flag turns off the prompt for instructions.
<P>
It is possible to search multiple databases,
as long as they have a common index made by
<I>indxbib.</I> In that case, only the first argument given to
<I>indxbib</I> is specified to
<I>lookbib.</I> <P>
If
<I>lookbib</I> does not find the index files (the .i[abc] files),
it looks for a reference file with the same name as the argument,
without the suffixes.
It creates a file with a &#39;.ig&#39; suffix, suitable for use with
<I>fgrep.</I> It then uses this fgrep file to find references.
This method is simpler to use, but the .ig file is slower to use
than the .i[abc] files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference files.

     <H3>NOTES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Probably all dates should be indexed,
since many disciplines refer to literature
written in the 1800s or earlier.
